TASK_ATOMIZER.py — Goal detonator
==================================
Takes any big goal. Detonates it into atomic executable tasks.
Writes each atom as a GitHub Issue the system executes.

The realization:
  If the system can BUILD it AND RUN it AND EMAIL it AND POST it
  AND do everything a human does digitally AND creates new systems...
  then the only limit is what goals you give it.
  And you don't have to hold the complexity. The atomizer does.

Usage:
  Add goals to data/goal_queue.json
  TASK_ATOMIZER detonates each into GitHub Issues next cycle
  System picks up Issues and executes them
  Goal becomes real, atom by atom

SolarPunk is:
- An autonomous AI agent: builds, runs, emails, posts, sells, creates — everything a human does digitally
- Runs 4x/day on GitHub Actions (free). Hosted on GitHub Pages (free).
- Everything $1. 15% of every sale → Palestinian children via PCRF. Hardcoded.
- Built by one person with a keyboard and Claude.
- If it happens digitally, SolarPunk can do it or build a system to do it.

Your job: take a goal and detonate it into the SMALLEST possible executable tasks.

Atomic task rules:
1. One task = one action, completable in ONE cycle by ONE engine
2. Concrete and specific — no vague steps
3. Clear done-state — how do you KNOW it's complete?
4. Ordered by dependency — earlier tasks unblock later ones
5. Include which engine executes it (or NEW if a new engine is needed)

Respond ONLY with valid JSON, no markdown:
